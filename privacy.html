              permitted to be displayed through the Invibe Platform and we may also collect information that you submit when using Invibe Services.

We may also request optional information from you to support and enhance your use of Invibe Services.

          </div>
          <h3>Location information</h3>
          <div class="legal-content">Our Service is also about sharing location and finding friends and others nearby, so we will use your location information to provide the basic functionality of the Service, such as displaying your location on the Services map to other users when you check-in using Third Party Services (social networks) or your specifically “on” in the application. Users viewing this information may use it or disclose it to other individuals or entities outside of our control and without your knowledge. Your location information may be subject to abuse, misuse, and monitoring by others, and you share your location at your own risk.</div>
          <h3>Personal Data from Other Sources</h3>
          <div class="legal-content">We may receive Personal Data about you from other sources such as the Social Network connected to the Invibe Platform, as well as Merchants and other third parties that help us improve your experience of Invibe Services and generally make Invibe Services better.

            <br/>

            products or services that may be of interest to you, Invibe
            may collect your email address and other related information
            also for that purpose. Invibe may use this email address to
            contact you for things such as notifications of
            limited-edition shop sales/promotions and other related
            advertisement information. You may at any time opt-out from
            any further advertisements to your email address by sending
            a notice to Invibe at <a

          </div>
          <h3>Information Collected via Technology</h3>
          <div class="legal-content">
            As you use Invibe Services, certain information may also be passively collected and stored on our or our service providers’ server logs, including your IP address, browser type and operating system. We may also use cookies (as defined below) and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (”URLs”) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the solutions and information for which you searched and viewed, or on which of the advertisements displayed on the Invibe Platform you clicked. This type of information is collected to make Invibe Services more useful to you and to tailor the experience with Invibe Services to meet your special interests and needs.
            <br/>
            For example, we, or our service providers, may track your IP Address when you access the Invibe Platform to assist with ad targeting. An “Internet protocol address” or “IP Address” is a number that is automatically assigned to your Device when you use the Internet. In some cases your IP Address stays the same from browser session to browser session, but if you use a consumer Internet access provider, your IP Address probably varies from session to session.
          </div>
          <h3>Cookies</h3>
          <div class="legal-content">
            “Cookies” are small pieces of information that Invibe sends to and stores on the Device that you use when accessing the Invibe Platform.
            <br/>
            Invibe uses cookies to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience with the Invibe Platform and to improve Invibe Services. Cookies help us evaluate what types of information that might be of interest to you and other users, to improve our and our Merchants’ advertisements and to protect you and Invibe from unlawful activities. We also use cookies to know when you are interacting with Merchants or other third parties.
            <br/>
            In order to use Invibe Services, your Device must accept cookies. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them). Persistent cookies can be removed or blocked by following your Internet browser´s help file directions. But some aspects of the Invibe Platform may not work properly and you may not be able to use Invibe Services if our cookies are removed or blocked.
          </div>
        <h2>7. Use and Disclosure of Personal Data</h2>
          <div class="legal-content">
            Personal Data that you submit to us is used by Invibe to provide you with access to the Invibe Platform and Invibe Services; to administer your Invibe Account; to improve Invibe Services; to better tailor the features, performance and support of the Invibe Platform; and to offer you additional information, opportunities, promotions and functionality from us (including in cases when we contact you in connection with specific Merchant opportunities and promotions).
            <br/>
            Invibe may provide your Personal Data to third-party service providers who work on behalf of or with us to provide some of the services and features of the Invibe Platform and to help us communicate with you. Examples of such services include sending email, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing payments (including credit card payments) and providing customer service. Such third-party service providers may only process Personal Data to provide the relevant services to Invibe and in accordance with Invibe’s instructions.
            <br/>
            The Personal Data that you provide will allow Invibe to inform you of Invibe Services, such as available gifts as well as other services and products that may be of interest to you. Invibe may use your Personal Data for processing, managing and providing you with retail offers, advertisements and other information related to your profile and interests. By using Invibe Services you agree that Invibe may contact you to conduct targeted advertising based on the information provided by you and collected by Invibe. This type of targeting is performed to make Invibe Services and solutions more useful to you and to tailor the experience with the Invibe Platform to meet your special interests and needs. Sometimes this type of targeting and other offers, advertisements and promotions is performed by Invibe on behalf of Merchants. Invibe does not disclose your Personal Data to Merchants, but may make certain of your non-personally identifiable demographic information (like age, gender and general location) available in connection with our agreements with Merchants. None of the information provided to Merchants would allow them to identify you or your Personal Data.
            <br/>
            We may promote third-party products and/or services by placing advertisements on the Invibe Platform on behalf of Merchants and ad servers. These Merchants may use cookies and/ or “Web Beacons” (which are usually small, transparent graphic images) in order to monitor information related to served advertisements. Clicking on such advertisements will direct you to the website of such Merchants. This Privacy Policy does not cover the privacy practices of any such Merchants, as further described in Section 7 (Third-Party Websites) in the Terms of Service.
            <br/>
            Your Personal Data may also form part of Invibe’s statistics but then we will exclude, for instance, your name. Invibe will generally aggregate this information and use it in statistical analysis to help us analyze patterns in the use of Invibe Services and to help Merchants indirectly (via Invibe) target users with the desired demographics. In addition to the above, Invibe may disclose your Personal Data if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on Invibe or pursuant to any other legal claims or (b) to protect and defend Invibe’s rights, property or interests or (c) to protect your rights or any third-party rights or (d) fight against fraud or (e) to enforce our policies (including this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service).
          </div>
        <h2>8. Ability to View Your Information</h2>
          <div class="legal-content">
            When you register a Invibe Account, your Social Network friends will be notified of your use of Invibe Services. Your Social Network friends with Invibe accounts will then be able to give you electronic gifts provided by various Merchants.
            <br/>
            It is up to you to make sure that you are comfortable with the information that you choose to provide to Invibe and the information you choose to publish either directly on the Invibe Platform or through your Social Network, which is connected to the Invibe Platform.
            <br/>
            You acknowledge that when you use Invibe Services, certain information that you post or provide through the Invibe Platform (such as your name, profile, comments, collections and reviews,) may be shared with other users and posted on publicly available portions of the Invibe Platform, including, without limitation, social media applications and other public fora (plural for forums ☺) in which you choose to participate. Please keep in mind that if you choose to disclose Personal Data when posting comments or other information or content through the Invibe Platform, this information may become publicly available and may be collected and used by others, including people outside the Invibe Platform. We will not have any obligations with respect to any information that you post via the Invibe Platform and make available to others, and recommend that you use caution when giving out Personal Data to others through Social Networks.
          </div>
        <h2>9. Security of Collected Information</h2>
          <div class="legal-content">
            Wrapp is committed to protecting the security of your Personal Data. We will take appropriate technical and organisational measures with due observance of the applicable obligations under relevant legislation to protect provided or otherwise collected Personal Data and traffic data. We use a variety of industry-standard security technologies and procedures to help protect your Personal Data from unauthorized or unlawful access, use or disclosure and accidental loss, destruction and damage. Even though Wrapp has taken significant steps to protect your Personal Data, no company, including ours, can fully eliminate security risks associated with Personal Data.
          </div>
        <h2>10. Access to, Rectifying and Deleting Your Personal Data</h2>
          <div class="legal-content">
            You are entitled, once a year, to request information from Invibe about the Personal Data relating to you which is being processed by Invibe and to request, where relevant, that such Personal Data is rectified by sending a notice to Invibe at the following address: Invibe ltd.
            <br/>
            Invibe will make all reasonable efforts to accommodate a request to delete Personal Data, unless such data is required to be retained pursuant to applicable laws, or for lawful business purposes, or to protect and defend Invibe’s rights, property or interests, or to fight against fraud, or to enforce our policies (including this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service). You may also, at any time, ask us to discontinue processing your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes by notifying us at the address above that you would like us to stop sending you promotional communication.
