        <h2>Links To Third Party Sites</h2>
        <div class="legal-content">We don’t have control over websites that InvibeUp may link to. InvibeUp may contain links to third party websites that are not owned, operated, or controlled by InvibeUp. Therefore, we cannot and do not assume responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of such websites or the companies that own them. Additionally, we cannot and will not censor or edit the content of any third party site. By using InvibeUp you expressly relieve us from any and all liability arising from your use of any third party website.</div>
        <h2>Gift Promotions</h2>
        <div class="legal-content">InvibeUp provides consumers with the ability to purchase gift promotions to be used at third party merchants (“Merchants”).</div>
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <div class="legal-content">InvibeUp allows its users to purchase and send Gift to be used in-store with participating Merchants. Users’ friends who receive Gifts redeem the specific gifts and services gifted by using a QR / Bar code or a unique reference number associated with each individual Gifts in-store at the participating Merchant locations where this Gifts is valid. Users’ friends are defined by friends available through the users’ Facebook account or the person directly associated with the mobile phone number or email address entered by the user at purchase of the Gifts.</div>
        <div class="legal-content">By placing an order for a given Gift, you agree to purchase the Gift you have selected on the terms, restrictions and conditions associated with Gift. Once you’ve placed your order, you will receive a confirmation of the purchase and your credit card or debit card will be charged for the amount of the paid Gift. Once the purchase is confirmed the Gift will be sent to the selected friend using InvibeUp’s platform. You are required to register an account with InvibeUp in order to purchase or redeem any Gift. An account is required so we can collect information to allow you to pay for your Gift and provide you with easy access to your friends list, view your past purchases, and modify your preferences.</div>
        <h2>The Gift & Expiry Date</h2>
        <div class="legal-content">Each Gift is to be used for the specific products and services gifted and can only be used at the specified participating Merchant stores in one visit. The Gift is not valid for cash backs (except in regions where this is required by law).</div>
        <div class="legal-content">The expiration date for a Gift is as printed or displayed on the Gift. If the expiration of the Gift as of the date printed on the Gift is prohibited under the law of the jurisdiction in which the Merchant is located, then the Gift shall expire five (5) years from the date the Gift is issued, except to the extent applicable law requires that the Merchant extend the period in which the Gift may be redeemed.</div>
        <div class="legal-content">The Merchant is obligated to honor the Gift in compliance with law. If the Merchant refuses to honor the Gift before the legally permitted expiration date, then InvibeUp will refund the amount of the paid Gift in the form of a credit for future gift promotions. In order to receive the credit, you must provide the following information in writing to support@invibe.me: (a) identification of the Gift and Merchant with whom you sought to redeem the Gift, (b) statement of the date, time, and circumstances in which the Merchant refused to redeem the Gift, and (c) a statement, under penalty of perjury, that the Gift has never been redeemed with the Merchant.</div>
        <h2>Gift Specific Terms</h2>
        <div class="legal-content">Each Gift can come with specific terms associated with the Gift, which will be presented to you at the time you commit to purchase the particular Gift and in connection with the Gift after its been distributed. Gift specific terms supersede any inconsistent terms in this Agreement, except to the extent such terms are prohibited by applicable law.</div>
        <h2>Global Terms</h2>
        <div class="legal-content">Unless otherwise stated in the Gift or required by law, the following additional terms apply to all gift promotions:
          <br/> 
          <ul class="legal-list">
            <li class="legal-item">no cash back or credit will be issued for partial redemption of the specific products and services on the Gift, except as required by law;</li>
            <li class="legal-item">use of a Gift for alcoholic beverages is at the sole discretion of the Merchant (which may be limited by applicable state or provincial law), unless otherwise noted on the Gift;</li>
            <li class="legal-item">gift promotions cannot be used for taxes, tips, prior balances, shipping or handling, as applicable;</li>
            <li class="legal-item">neither InvibeUp nor the Merchant is responsible for lost or stolen gift promotions or unique Gift reference numbers;</li>
